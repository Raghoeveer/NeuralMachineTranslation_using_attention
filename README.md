# Neural Machine Translation Using Attention

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) using attention mechanisms where in we try to translate German sentences to english ones using the IWSLT2017 dataset. The model is designed to translate text from one language to another and leverages attention mechanisms to improve translation quality.

## Features

- **Neural Machine Translation**: Utilizes a neural network architecture for machine translation tasks.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Implements attention mechanisms to enhance translation performance, particularly for handling long-range dependencies.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Includes scripts for training the model on your own dataset and evaluating its performance.
- **Customization**: Easily customizable for experimenting with different hyperparameters, architectures, and datasets.
